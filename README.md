<h1>BnS Hotkey Plugin Example</h1>
<p>Example code of how to do a hotkey system in your plugin, this is just raw code. If you want a full sample template with compiler flags set you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/Tonnilson/bnspatch">https://github.com/Tonnilson/bnspatch</a>
I got tired of doing a large series of if statements and came up with a hotkey manager which should be easier to understand and use then looking at my previous sources.</p>
